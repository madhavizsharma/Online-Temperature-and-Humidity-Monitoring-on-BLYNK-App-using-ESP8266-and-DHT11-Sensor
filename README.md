# Online-Temperature-and-Humidity-Monitoring-on-BLYNK-App-using-ESP8266-and-DHT11-Sensor
This is a small IoT project which monitors a room temperature and humidity data and store on the cloud to be monitored online.

[Blynk](https://blynk.io/) is an IoT Platform used with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP8266 and NodeMCU and other microcontrollers. Blynk app is a digital dashboard where you will be able to build or design a graphical interface for any IoT based project by just drag and drop widgets.

In this project we use [ESP8266](https://components101.com/wireless/esp8266-pinout-configuration-features-datasheet) to take the sensor data from [DHT11](https://components101.com/dht11-temperature-sensor) and then connect with Blynk app to send those data to the cloud.
